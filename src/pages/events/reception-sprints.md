## More Details

### Reception

Receptions will include pizza, salad, desserts, and beverages

### Sprints

For those unfamiliar with the term: sprints are cooperative coding sessions where you work side-by-side with other PyOhio participants to improve an open-source project.

You can:

- Write something new
- Extend an existing package (yours, or someone else's)
- Fix bugs
- Write tests
- Improve documentation

It's a great way to contribute to the community, learn about coding and open-source contribution, and have fun with new and old PyOhio friends.

### What you need

*Experience not needed* - sprinting is actually a great way to <em>gain</em> experience. Just bring a laptop!

### Projects

None posted (yet!)

### Want to lead a sprint?

Add a project to the list announce it in the #sprints channel in [PyOhio Slack](https://slack.pyohio.org) or email info@pyohio.org with the information.
