We do not have an official hotel block this year.

Traditionally many PyOhio attendees stay at [The Blackwell](https://www.theblackwell.com/) which is located on the OSU campus a short distance from The Ohio Union however space there is limited due to other events the same weekend.

A [number of other hotels](https://www.google.com/maps/search/hotel/@39.9983564,-83.0254681,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m16!2m15!3m6!1shotel!2sOhio+Union,+Columbus,+OH+43210!3s0x88388eb8e1ad7407:0x6eb50adaef6f6294!4m2!1d-83.00776!2d39.998361!5m6!5m4!1s2019-07-26!2i3!4m1!1i1!10e1!6e3) are also located in the area.
