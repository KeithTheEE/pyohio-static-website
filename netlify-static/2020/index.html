          PyOhio 2020 Status & COVID-19 Update - March 31, 2020

        <div class="card-body">
          <p>It has become clear that holding a large public event in July will not be possible, therefore:</p>
          <p><strong>PyOhio 2020 will not be held in-person at the Ohio Union in Columbus, OH on July 25-26.</strong></p>
          <p>We are considering options for a virtual event to be held on the same date(s.) While this would not replace
          in-person gathering for discussion and networking, our goal is to provide a venue for meaningful connections
          for the PyOhio community.</p>
          <p>We plan to release further details within the next two weeks via our newsletter and website.</p>

          <p>The health, safety, and wellbeing of the community is always our top priority. Keeping that in mind, and considering the current climate of uncertainty, we have decided to postpone the open of our CFP for now.</p>
          <p>PyOhio 2020 is currently scheduled for July 25-26 in Columbus, OH. While the event is still more than four months in the future, mid-March is typically when we are confirming sponsorships and beginning our CFP process. Given the unknowns we felt it would be unfair to have people prepare proposals and start working on presentations at this time.</p>
          <p>Weâ€™re committed to organizing the right event for the PyOhio community when it is appropriate. This may include changes to our schedule or format. In this situation we are fortunate that we run the event on a small budget and have little in the way of financial liabilities at this point in the process.</p>
          <p>We plan to reassess the situation as we learn more and will provide an update here and via our newsletter by the end of March.</p>
          <p>Take care of yourselves and each other out there.</p>
